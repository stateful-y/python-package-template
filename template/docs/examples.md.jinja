## What is marimo?

marimo is a reactive Python notebook that's:
- **Reactive**: Run a cell and marimo automatically runs dependent cells

- **Git-friendly**: Stored as pure `.py` files
- **Executable**: Run as scripts or deploy as web apps

uv run marimo edit examples/hello.py
```

### Run as Script

Execute the notebook as a Python script:

### Deploy as App
